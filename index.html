			<h1>DIGITAL TECH FROM DATA, ROBOTICS & Al</h1>
			<p>AI research keeps reaching new milestones. The deep learning paradigm keeps reaffirming its dominance year after year. It seems safe to assume that neural networks will govern the future of AI. Yet, promises keep falling short. Artificial general intelligence (AGI) doesnâ€™t seem to be near despite what some claim. AI systems are still very dumb and narrow. There seems to be a missing gap between where AI is and where we want it to be.</p>

				<h2>UNDERSTANDING 5G</h2>
				<p> 5G is based on OFDM (Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing), a method of modulating a digital signal across several different channels to reduce interference. 5G uses 5G NR air interface alongside OFDM principles. 5G also uses wider bandwidth technologies such as sub-6 GHz and mmWave.</p>
